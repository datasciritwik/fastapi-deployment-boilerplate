To deploy the production-ready FastAPI app (built above) on Google Cloud Run, follow this step-by-step guide:

⸻

🚀 Step 1: Prerequisites
	•	✅ You have a Google Cloud Project created.
	•	✅ You have the gcloud CLI installed & authenticated:

gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID


⸻

🐳 Step 2: Build Docker Image with Cloud Build (Recommended)

From your FastAPI project root:

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/fastapi-prod

If you want to build locally instead:

docker build -t gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/fastapi-prod .
docker push gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/fastapi-prod


⸻

☁️ Step 3: Deploy to Cloud Run

gcloud run deploy fastapi-service \
  --image gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/fastapi-prod \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --port 80

Replace us-central1 with your preferred region.
You can restrict unauthenticated access by removing --allow-unauthenticated.

📁 FastAPI Port Configuration Recap

Your Docker container listens on port 80, so Cloud Run’s --port 80 ensures proper routing.

⸻

✅ Output

After a successful deployment, you’ll see a URL like:

https://fastapi-service-abcdefg-uc.a.run.app

Your FastAPI app is now live on Google Cloud Run! 🌐

⸻

📦 Optional: Enable Continuous Deployment

You can enable automatic builds on GitHub push using:

gcloud beta run deploy --source . --region us-central1

This builds and deploys directly from your source directory (no Dockerfile build needed locally).

⸻

Would you like to add a custom domain, VPC connector, env vars, or Secrets Manager integration to this Cloud Run deployment?
